  <h1>Common Meta Tags</h1>
  <p>There are an unlimited number of meta tags, but the common ones are:</p>

  <h2>charset</h2>
  <p>Setting the charset attribute on a meta tag tells the browser what encoding you're including in your web page. 
    It allows you to use utf-8 characters directly in your webpage, such as the Â¥ (yuan) symbol. 
    This page is encoded in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8" target="_blank">UTF-8</a>. 
    <em>Note: some browsers will assume a charset intelligently, but we shouldn't rely on this.</em>.
  </p>

  <h2>description</h2>
  <p>A meta tag with a <strong>name</strong> of <strong>description</strong> and a <strong>content</strong> attribute will help browsers, search engines, and accessibility tools understand
    how your web page is described. Every web page should have a description.
  </p>

  <h2>keywords</h2>
  <p>A meta tag with a name of <strong>keywords</strong> and a content attribute will help browsers, search engines, and accessibility tools understand
    the main topics on a given page. You can think of it like a hashtag in social media!
  </p>

  <h2>author</h2>
  <p>A meta tag with a name of <strong>keywords</strong> and a content attribute will help browsers, search engines, and accessibility tools understand
    the who wrote a page. It can be a personal name, a company name, or some other entity that describes authorship for a page or information on a page.
