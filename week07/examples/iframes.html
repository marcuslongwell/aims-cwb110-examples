  <h1>IFrames</h1>
  <p>The <strong>&lt;iframe&gt;</strong> tag can be used to embed other pages into a web page.</p>
  <p>Here's a iframe that puts bing into our website:</p>

  <iframe width="1000" height="500" src="https://bing.com"></iframe>

  <p>Please note, however, that while iframes can be used in some cases, you often want to use them sparingly. One of the more populare applications of
    iframes is to use them to embed videos into web pages when you don't want to host the video files yourself.</p>
  <p>For example, if you go to YouTube and click to embed a video, YouTube will generate iframe code that looks like this:</p>

  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_OBlgSz8sSM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  <p>Note that if you go to the source of the iframe, it's a web page, not a video file download!</p>
