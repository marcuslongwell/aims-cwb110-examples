  <h1>Metadata</h1>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=define+metadata&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS872US872&oq=define+metadata&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l7.1521j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">
    Google definition of metadata</a> is: a set of data that describes and gives information about other data.</p>

  <p>We have been using metadata all semester long. In fact, in every assignment you've submitted so far, you should have two pieces
    of metadata in your HTML documents: Your &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; tag and your &lt;title&gt; tag!</p>

  <p>Your title is not only information that shows up in the tab of your browser, but it is also information that describes your webpage.
    And if metadata is data/information that describes other data, then it follows that your title is metadata.
  </p>

  <p>That being said, the purpose of metadata is often times not to show information on the page, but to help other services
    such as browsers, search engines, and accessibility tools to understand what the page is.
  </p>

  <p>Meta tags always go in the &lt;head&gt; tag, while your page content goes in the &lt;body&gt; tag.</p>
