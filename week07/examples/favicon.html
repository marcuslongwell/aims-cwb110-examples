  <h1>Favicon</h1>
  <p>You've seen favicons all over the web. A favicon is an image used to represent the icon or logo of a web page or website.</p>
  <p>Favicons are used in the bookmarks menu, in the search bar, in tabs, and everywhere else you can imagine needing a site icon for your website.</p>
  <p>You can include a favicon in your page by using the &lt;link&gt; tag with a <strong>rel</strong> attribute of <strong>icon</strong> and an
  <strong>href</strong> attribute that defines a path to the image you want to use. Generally speaking, your icon should be either a png or an ico file.</p>
