  <h1>Grouping Styles</h1>
  <p>If you remember a while back, we talked about how, often times, as a web developer, you want to put things in boxes.</p>
  <p>At the time, it didn't make much sense. But luckily for us, now we can use those groups.</p>

  <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #000000; color: white;">
    <p>I'm in a black box with some padding.</p>
    <p>I'm another paragraph in the same black box with some padding</p>
    <p>Notice that all of this text is white, even though these paragraphs don't have any styles on them.</p>
    <p>The reason they don't have to have styles on them is because they're grouped inside a box (a &lt;div&gt; tag), and the 
      color style from that div tag cascades down to the paragraph tags.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>But now, if I add another paragraph outside of the box, it no longer has the white text color.</p>
