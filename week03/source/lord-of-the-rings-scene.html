<h2>My Favorite Scene of "The Lord of the Rings"</h2>
<p>Here is Prof. Longwell's favorite scene from "The Fellowship of the Ring", part one of his favorite trilogy.</p>
<p>
<strong>FRODO</strong>: 
<q>I wish the ring had never come to me...<b />I wish none of this had happened.</q>
</p>
<p><strong>GANDALF:<q>So do all who live to see such times, but<br />that is not for them to decide. All we<br have to decide is what to do with the<br />time that is given to us.</q><br /> There is a note of finality in Gandalf's voice.</p>
<p><strong>GANDALF</strong> (continues):<br /><q>There are other forces at work in thisworld, Frodo, besides the will of evil.<br />Bilbo was meant to find the ring. In<br />which case, you also were meant to have<br />it...and that is an encouraging thought,</q><br /><em>(sudden brightness)</em><br /><q>Ah! That it's that way! Gandalf points<br />at the right hand tunnel...the Fellowship<br />scramble to their feet.</q></p>
